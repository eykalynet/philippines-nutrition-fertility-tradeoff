**Nutritional Deficits and the Quantity–Quality Trade-off**  
Schupf Fellowship Research Project – Summer 2025

This project investigates how exogenous increases in fertility, driven by restricted access to contraception, affect parental investment in child health outcomes in the Philippines. Using pooled microdata from the 1998, 2003, and 2008 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), I analyze the impact of Executive Order No. 003, an anti-contraception policy implemented in Manila in 2000, on fertility patterns and subsequent child nutrition and immunization.

The study employs reduced-form and instrumental variables (IV) strategies to estimate the causal effect of sibship size on early childhood outcomes, including birth weight and vaccine uptake by age five. Findings contribute to the literature on the quantity–quality trade-off by showing that increases in fertility are associated with lower postnatal health investments, particularly in preventive care.
