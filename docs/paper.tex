This paper examines whether increased fertility affects early-life

experiment created by a 1990 policy in Manila, Philippines, which banned
modern contraceptives from city-run health facilities. Using a
difference-in-differences framework and nationally representative data

\section{Introduction}

The trade-off between child quantity and child quality is a foundational
concept in the economics of the family. First articulated by
\citet{becker1960economic} and extended in subsequent models of
household behavior \citep{beckerlewis1973, beckertomes1976}, this
framework posits that parents allocate finite resources---both financial
and non-financial---across children. An increase in fertility reduces
the resources available per child and, under binding constraints, may
lead to lower investments in health, education, and other forms of human
capital. This mechanism has served as an explanatory model for changes
in fertility behavior and the evolution of population structures in low-
and middle-income countries.

Empirical investigations of the quantity--quality trade-off have focused
primarily on educational outcomes. Studies in both high-income and
low-income settings have examined the effects of fertility on school
enrollment, grade progression, test scores, and completed years of
schooling
\citep{rosenzweig1980testing, black2005more, angrist2010effects}. These
outcomes serve as accessible proxies for long-run human capital
accumulation, but they represent only one dimension of child quality.
Other outcomes, such as nutritional status, are early-onset or
biologically constrained. They also tend to be less responsive to
remediation later in life. A child who suffers from chronic malnutrition
may exhibit permanently reduced cognitive capacity and face limits in
physical development that affect long-run productivity regardless of
subsequent educational access
\citep{hoddinott2013adult, grantham2007development}.

The exclusion of nutritional outcomes from much of the empirical
literature leaves an important dimension of the trade-off untested.
Nutritional investments in early childhood are essential to early
childhood development and long-term outcomes
\citep{victora2008maternal, hoddinott2013adult}. They shape brain
development, immune system functioning, and physical stature, and they
have been shown to predict later-life earnings and health outcomes
across a wide range of settings
\citep{grantham2007development, alderman2006long}. The biological
irreversibility of early-life nutritional deficits further distinguishes
them from other forms of investment. Educational deficits may be
partially remediable; nutritional failures often are not. A credible
estimate of the trade-off between fertility and child quality must
account for nutrition if it aims to assess the full set of consequences
associated with fertility shocks.

This study addresses this gap by examining the nutritional effects of a
localized, exogenous increase in fertility in the Philippines. In 1990,
the mayor of Manila implemented an executive policy that prohibited the
provision of modern contraceptives in all city-run health facilities.
The order removed access to pills, condoms, intrauterine devices, and
related public health materials and instructed healthcare providers to
offer only natural family planning methods. This policy remained in
place for nearly a decade and affected only the jurisdiction of the
Manila city government. The national government did not implement a
comparable restriction, and surrounding cities within Metro Manila
continued to provide access to modern contraceptives. The policy thus
created a spatial and temporal discontinuity in contraceptive access
that was uncorrelated with underlying fertility preferences or
concurrent shifts in household income or governance. As a result, the
Manila ban serves as a quasi-experimental source of variation in
fertility exposure among poor urban households.

I use this natural experiment to estimate the causal effect of increased
fertility on child nutrition. The analysis relies on nationally
representative data from multiple waves of the Philippine Demographic
and Health Survey (DHS), which provide data on household structure and
maternal characteristics, as well as measurements of child
anthropometry. The outcomes of interest are height-for-age and
weight-for-height z-scores, which serve as standardized indicators of
chronic and acute malnutrition, respectively. These outcomes are widely
used in the global health and development literature and capture
nutritional deprivation over both long and short time horizons
\citep{victora2008maternal}. The empirical strategy follows a
difference-in-differences design that compares child outcomes in Manila
and comparable urban areas before and after the onset of the policy.

The identification strategy rests on two key assumptions. First, in the
absence of the contraceptive ban, nutritional trends in Manila would
have evolved in parallel with those in comparison cities. Second, any
other policy or economic shocks affecting Manila during the study period
must not coincide precisely with the timing and scope of the
contraceptive policy. I test these assumptions using falsification
checks, placebo comparisons, and robustness specifications that include
city-specific time trends, maternal fixed effects, and controls for
baseline demographic differences.

The analysis proceeds in three stages. I first replicate existing work
\citep{dumas2019sex} to confirm that the contraceptive ban led to an
increase in fertility among affected women. I then estimate reduced-form
effects of policy exposure on nutritional outcomes for children under
five years of age. Finally, I examine heterogeneity in effects across
subsamples defined by maternal education, household wealth, and access
to prenatal care. These dimensions serve as proxies for household
resource availability and capacity to buffer the nutritional
consequences of fertility increases.

This research contributes to the literature in several respects. It
introduces new evidence on the nutritional consequences of fertility
shocks in an urban developing-country context. It expands the
measurement of child quality beyond educational outcomes to include
biological indicators. It also adds to the limited body of work that
uses plausibly exogenous variation in reproductive health policy to
study downstream effects on human capital. More broadly, the findings
underscore the potential for local family planning restrictions to
generate unintended consequences for child well-being in settings
characterized by poverty, food insecurity, and institutional fragility.

\section{Review of Related Literature}

\subsection{Theoretical Background}

The quantity--quality (Q--Q) trade-off is a core idea in the economics
of fertility. It formalizes the constraint that when parents face a
fixed income, they must allocate limited resources between the number of
children they have and the amount invested in each child's development.
In this framework, ``quality'' refers to any investment that raises a
child's human capital---such as nutrition, education, healthcare---while
``quantity'' refers simply to the number of children. Because these
investments are resource-intensive, increasing one often comes at the
expense of the other.

Becker's foundational model \citep{becker1960economic} formalizes this
as a constrained optimization problem. A household maximizes utility
over the number of children \(n\), child quality \(q\), and consumption
\(c\):

\[\max_{n,q,c} \quad U(n, q, c)\]

subject to the budget constraint:

\[I = c + n(p_n + p_q q),\]

where \(I\) is household income, \(p_n\) is the fixed cost per child
(e.g., food, shelter), and \(p_q\) is the marginal cost of investing in
child quality. The budget constraint makes the trade-off explicit:
increasing \(n\) reduces how much can be spent on \(q\), and vice versa.
